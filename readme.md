Mathapedia + LaTeX2HTML5
====================


DEPRECATED!

Visit [latex2js](http://latex2js.com)

====================


Notes for revival (locally)

## initialize db

```
docker-compose up 
```

* login as root with the example password in compose file
* create the database latex2html5_db
* load the sql dump in the admin (localhost:8080)
* dump file is located in Dans preferred cloud drive `>websites>mathapedia`

## build the frontend and start app

* install and old version of `bbb`
* build it
* start it on release mode

```
npm install -g bbb@0.1.16
bbb release
RELEASE=1 node server/app.js
```

## NOTES

it's completely frontend rendered, so to make this a static site, need to build in rendering.


====================


GOOD NEWS! This project now has a frontend-only version: [latex2html5](http://latex2html5.com) ([github](https://github.com/Mathapedia/LaTeX2HTML5))

The loose structure and nature of user interface design poses a problem for documenting science and related interfaces in a consistent manner. TeX provides us with some "laws" to obey in order to design the output of a text and graphical language around. Hence, we can attempt to create a synthesis of a structured user interface specification (TeX) and a structured functional specification (HTML5) to provide a publishing platform for the current and next generation.

The Art is where we can blend these two standards bodies; higher levels of abstraction allow people to express their ideas without having to worry about the mechanisms by which the technology is rendering their works. It is in these environments when people can express themselves freely.

Adding new LaTeX commands
=========================

If there is one takeaway for developers, the most important files for adding (LaTeX) functionality: expressions.js, psgraph.js, renderer.js

Installation
============

* nginx v0.8.54 
* nodejs v0.8.11
* mysql v14.14

installing nodejs, npm, and mysql
---------------------------------

These three installations vary from machine to machine. Your best bet is to use Google for this.


get the code
---------------------

    cd /var/www
    git clone https://github.com/pyramation/LaTeX2HTML5.git


install node packages
---------------------

these run globally (they are for the build and monitoring):

    npm install -g forever
    npm install -g bbb

The rest is a part of the repo and can be installed more easily:

    cd /var/www/LaTeX2HTML5
    npm install

Database Setup
--------------

Create a mysql user

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON latex2html5_db.* TO latex2html5@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'skateboard321' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Create the database

    CREATE DATABASE latex2html5_db;

Initialize database

    cd /var/www/LaTeX2HTML5
    bbb db:migrate


Web Server Setup
----------------

make public folder and create symbolic links that alias the public folders

    cd /var/www
    mkdir public
    cd public
    ln -s ../LaTeX2HTML5/dist dist
    ln -s ../LaTeX2HTML5/app app

Edit nginx.conf in /usr/local/nginx/conf or wherever it was installed so that you proxy port 9000 and point to the public folder for the root:


    worker_processes  1;

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
        include       mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;

        sendfile        on;
        keepalive_timeout  65;

        upstream math_server {
            server localhost:9000 fail_timeout=0;
        }

        proxy_set_header Host yourdomain.com;
        proxy_set_header X-forwarded-for $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        server {
            listen       80;
            server_name  localhost;
            root /var/www/public/;

            location / {
                   try_files $uri @backer;
            }
            location @backer {
               proxy_pass http://math_server$request_uri;
            }
            location ~* \.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|js|css)$ {
                expires max;
                log_not_found off;
            }

            #error_page  404              /404.html;

            # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   html;
            }

        }

    }


We are utilizing many various open source projects. Thank you, thank you, thank you open source community!!!!!!


Starting the Server for Development
-----------------------------------

    cd /var/www/LaTeX2HTML5
    npm start


Starting the Server for Production
----------------------------------

    bbb release
    RELEASE=1 forever start server/app.js 


Working Locally
---------------

If you want to work locally and use some.com in your browser, you can edit your `/etc/hosts/` file

    127.0.0.1 math.com
